Map parsing:
    - must be a .cub file
    - flood fill
    - player start position
    - map surrounded by walls
    - proper map dimensions
    - initialize player

Window creation:
    - mlx_init, mlx_loop, mlx_terminate

Ray casting:
    - calculate ray direction based on player position and orientation
    - calculate how long a ray must be based on the map grid
    - field of view must look sensible (wall height consistent relative to player position, no distortion)

Event handling:
    - key presses for movement
    - closing window
    - collisions (not required by mandatory part)

Textures:
    - initializing mlx42
    - paths to textures
    - create images + apply textures
    - destroying/freeing textures before exiting
